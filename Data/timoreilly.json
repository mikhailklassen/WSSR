The \u201clabor share\u201d of national income \u2014 the portion of the national economic pie that goes to workers\u2019 pay, as opposed to corporate profits and elsewhere \u2014 has fallen. And average pay for nonmanagerial workers has grown more slowly than the overall economy.This has coincided with disappointing results for the economy. Worker productivity has been rising slowly for the last decade, and prime working-age Americans are staying out of the work force in droves. This implies that plenty of people don\u2019t see jobs out there that offer sufficient pay or opportunity to make the jobs worth doing.Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people.Just maybe, in other words, employers across the country are pushing down labor costs like Walmart, circa 2014 \u2014 and this is one of the major culprits behind disappointing economic results since the start of the 21st century.\"\u201cThe management philosophy that became popular in the 1980s that led companies to cut pay for low-wage workers, fight unions and contract out work may have been profitable for the companies that practiced it in the short run,\u201d said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and leading scholar of labor markets. \u201cBut in the long run it has raised inequality, reduced aggregate consumption and hurt overall business profitability.\u201d", "title": "From an article about Walmart, their move to pay more, and the lessons for the broader economy: http..."}, {"content": "\u201cI\u2019m a science geek.

It has been investigated or sued in recent years by prosecutors in at least 12 states. The Justice Department has accused the company of illegally using incentives to pay its recruiters. And last year, investors filed a class-action lawsuit, contending that the company engaged in deceptive enrollment practices and manipulated federal student loan and grant programs.\u00a0Education Management nonetheless received more than $1.25 billion in federal money over the last school year....\"The continuing flow of money illustrates the quandary facing federal education officials. On one hand, they have moved forcefully to try to protect taxpayer funds and prevent students from falling deeply into debt without anything to show for it. On the other, they must avoid running roughshod over private for-profit schools that have not been found guilty of wrongdoing. Agency officials point out that they cannot withhold money based on accusations, but must have proof of misconduct.\"The fundamental notion that you can only regulate by punishing wrongdoing is at the heart of the failure. Good regulatory systems are management systems, that keep a system operating smoothly.A plane's autopilot does not kick in after the plane has crashed. It is designed to keep it from crashing. Credit card fraud detection software doesn't wait till you've gone bankrupt from fraudulent charges to intervene and stop further transactions.

Edna St Vincent Millay captured that tragedy perfectly in Dirge without Music:\"I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely. CrownedWith lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,A formula, a phrase remains,\u2014but the best is lost.The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,\u2014They are gone. They are gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curledIs the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.Down, down, down into the darkness of the graveGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\"", "title": "How fragile life is, even for the best of us.

We have too much of it in most areas, we have too little of it in others, but mostly, we just have the wrong kind, a mountain of paper rules, inefficient processes, and little ability to adjust the rules or the processes when we discover the inevitable unintended results.\"Consider, for a moment, regulation in a broader context. Your car\u2019s electronics regulate the fuel-air mix in the engine to find an optimal balance of fuel efficiency and minimal emissions. An airplane\u2019s autopilot regulates the countless factors required to keep that plane aloft and heading in the right direction. Credit card companies monitor and regulate charges to detect fraud and keep you under your credit limit. Doctors regulate the dosage of the medicine they give us, sometimes loosely, sometimes with exquisite care, as with the chemotherapy required to kill cancer cells while keeping normal cells alive, or with the anesthesia that keeps us unconscious during surgery while keeping vital processes going. ISPs and corporate mail systems regulate the mail that reaches us, filtering out spam and malware to the best of their ability. Search engines regulate the results and advertisements they serve up to us, doing their best to give us more of what we want to see.\"What do all these forms of regulation have in common?\"A deep understanding of the desired outcome\"Real-time measurement to determine if that outcome is being achieved\"Algorithms (i.e. a set of rules) that make adjustments based on new data\"Periodic, deeper analysis of whether the algorithms themselves are correct and performing as expected.\"There are a few cases\u2014all too few\u2014in which governments and quasi-governmental agencies regulate using processes similar to those outlined above. Probably the best example is the way that central banks regulate the money supply in an attempt to manage interest rates, inflation, and the overall state of the economy. Surprisingly, while individual groups might prefer the US Federal Reserve to tighten or loosen the money supply at a different time or rate than they do, most accept the need for this kind of regulation.\"Why is this?\"The desired outcomes are clear\"There is regular measurement and reporting as to whether those outcomes are being achieved, based on data that is made public to everyone\"Adjustments are made when the desired outcomes are not being achieved\"Contrast this with the normal regulatory model, which focuses on the rules rather than the outcomes.

We have a delivery crisis!\" \u00a0We endlessly promote new policies that are supposed to fix everything, but pay little attention to what it will take to actually implement them.In an In an interview with Charlie Rose, Steven Brill said something similar about the failure of healthcare.gov in the disconnect between policy and implementation: \u201cThe way they managed this program, it was almost as if they thought that actual governing, the nuts and bolts of governing, is for peons. And they are policy people.\u201d (See http://linkd.in/1o0RSOj)In this particular case, there is little or no teacher training, no supervision:\u00a0\"The trouble always starts when teachers are told to put innovative ideas into practice without much guidance on how to do it. In the hands of unprepared teachers, the reforms turn to nonsense, perplexing students more than helping them....\"\"With the Common Core, teachers are once more being asked to unlearn an old approach and learn an entirely new one, essentially on their own. Training is still weak and infrequent, and principals \u2014 who are no more skilled at math than their teachers \u2014 remain unprepared to offer support. Textbooks, once again, have received only surface adjustments, despite the shiny Common Core labels that decorate their covers.\"By contrast, Japan took not just the ideas of how to teach math better, but also put those ideas carefully and thoroughly into practice. \u00a0\"In Japan, teachers had always depended on jugyokenkyu, which translates literally as \u201clesson study,\u201d a set of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft. A teacher first plans lessons, then teaches in front of an audience of students and other teachers along with at least one university observer. Then the observers talk with the teacher about what has just taken place. Each public lesson poses a hypothesis, a new idea about how to help children learn. And each discussion offers a chance to determine whether it worked. Without jugyokenkyu, it was no wonder the American teachers\u2019 work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers. Without jugyokenyku, Takahashi never would have learned to teach at all. Neither, certainly, would the rest of Japan\u2019s teachers.\"This is a must-read piece if you care about education, or even just, if like many parents, you are struggling to help your own children make up for the terrible math education they are getting in school.", "title": "Why Common Core is Like Healthcare.gov\n\nDraw a bold line between this piece on the failure of the Common..."}, {"content": "Stories like this make me ashamed to be a US citizen. \u00a0We are abdicating our responsibility as citizens as long as we allow our government - the one institution that is designed to look out for everyone equally - to outsource key functions to for-profit companies, and then look away as they use their position to abuse the powerless!", "title": "Stories like this make me ashamed to be a US citizen. \u00a0We are abdicating our responsibility as citizens..."}, {"content": "Back now from a wonderful holiday in Ireland. \u00a0It included a \"Hawk Walk\" in Killarney with Killarney Falconry. \u00a0At the end, we had this picture with a hunting owl. \u00a0(He only hunts at night, but he takes pictures during the day :-)", "title": "Back now from a wonderful holiday in Ireland. \u00a0It included a \"Hawk Walk\" in Killarney with Killarney..."}, {"content": "Kurdish vs Palestinian Strategies for IndependenceThis article makes a really good point, contrasting the Kurds with the Palestinians:\"This is what Barham Salih, the former prime minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government, told me years ago: \u201cCompare us to other liberation movements around the world.

It really echoed some of the issues that we've seen at +Code for America\u00a0- there's a section at the end of the article that is going to be quoted often by people involved in the business of improving government services:\"If poverty is about time and mental bandwidth as well as money, how does this change how we combat its effects? 'When we think about programs for the poor, we don\u2019t ever think, hey, let\u2019s give them programs that don\u2019t use a lot of bandwidth,' says Mr. Mullainathan. Instead, we fault people for failing to sign up for programs that are ostensibly available, even though we don\u2019t factor in the time and cognitive capacity they need to get past even the first step.\u201c'If I give people a very complicated form, it\u2019s a big demand on cognitive capacity,' Mr. Shafir says. 'Take something like the Fafsa' \u2014 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \u2014 'Why is pickup for the low-income families less than 30 percent? People are already overwhelmed, and you go and give them an incredibly complicated form.'\"To him, the obvious conclusion is to radically change our thinking. 'Just like you wouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 to fill out a form, you shouldn\u2019t charge them $1,000 in cognitive complexity,' he says. One study found that if you offer help with filling out the Fafsa form, pickup goes up significantly.\"It starts with empathyJake Solomon has another take on the issue, which he explains so well in his post People, Not Data\u00a0https://medium.com/@lippytak/people-not-data-47434acb50a8 about the work he and the other Code for America fellows in San Francisco did last year to simplify the compliance for Food Stamp recipients. \u00a0What I love about Maria's article, though, is that it gives another way of thinking about why complex government forms are even worse than they appear, especially when it comes to providing services to people least able to deal with them.", "title": "\u00a0+Maria Konnikova's NY Times article about the role of time and attention scarcity in the cycle of poverty..."}]
