# WSSR
Sample code for the workshop on "Mining the Social Web", part of WSSR at Concordia University in Montreal, QC.

## Running the Sample Code

The easiest way to start experimenting with the code it use [Binder](https://mybinder.org) by clicking on the badge below:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mikhailklassen/WSSR/master)

Binder takes this GitHub repository and launches a Jupyter Notebook server that temporarily hosts all the Notebooks and data in this repository. It's important to remember that anything running on Binder is not stored permanently, so use it only for playing around with the code.

If you like using Jupyter Notebooks and want to be able to save your work, you have a few options:

1. Install Python, Jupyter, and any dependencies on your own computer. The easiest way of doing this is by downloading and installing [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). To run the Jupyter Notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows): 

`jupyter notebook`

2. Run your code on a hosted Jupyter Notebook server. You have a few free and paid options:
* [Gryd](https://gryd.us/)
* [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com)
* [Kaggle kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
* [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/)

Most of these will require you to create an account.
