      "Anna Lauren Hoffman will present an online training course, Data Ethics: Designing for Fairness in the Age of Algorithms , October 4-5, 2016. Register now for hands-on practice seeing the warning signs early in your design process.\n",
      "When I explain the value of ethics to students and professionals alike, I refer it as an “orientation.” As any good designer, scientist, or researcher knows, how you orient yourself toward a problem can have a big impact on the sort of solution you develop—and how you get there. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote , “perception is not whimsical, but fatal.” Your particular perspective, knowledge of, and approach to a problem shapes your solution, opening up certain paths forward and forestalling others.\n",
      "Data-driven approaches to business help optimize measurable outcomes—but the early planning of a project needs to account for the ethical (and in many cases, the literal) landscape to avoid ethically treacherous territory. Several recent cases in the news illustrate this point and show the type of preparation that enables a way to move forward in both a data-driven and ethical fashion: Princeton Review’s ZIP-code-based pricing scheme, which turned out to unfairly target Asian-American families , and Amazon’s same-day-delivery areas , which neglect majority-Black neighborhoods.\n",
      "You can approach a new project using a road trip analogy. The destination is straightforward—profit, revenue, or another measurable KPI. But the path you take to get there will need to be determined. If my wife and I, for example, want to drive from our apartment in Oakland (Point A) to visit my wife’s sister in Los Angeles (Point B), we have to figure out how we’d like to approach the trip. If we’re concerned primarily with efficiency, certain questions immediately come to the fore, namely: what’s the fastest route to LA? Determining the fastest route requires us to pay attention to certain features of the possible trip, such as traffic speeds, easily accessible gas stations, and traffic conditions.\n",
      "On the other hand, if my wife and I are interested in taking the most scenic route from Oakland to LA, a whole different set of concerns become salient. Gas stations are likely still relevant, but speed is less of a factor. We’ll also want to take into account things like notable landmarks and towns (and my tendency toward car sickness) along the way.\n",
      "The destination is the same; the laws we have to abide by are the same, but how we get from Point A to Point B, then, is heavily determined by how we orient ourselves toward the trip in the first place.\n",
      "The same goes for research or design projects: how you orient yourself or your team toward solving certain problems or achieving certain goals will fundamentally shape the journey you take. If you’re interested in reaching a goal as quickly as possible—if your only concern is speed or turnaround time—a particular set of concerns are going to be salient. But if you’re interested in reaching a goal not only efficiently but ethically, then a different set of concerns will pop up.\n",
      "Moreover, understanding ethics as a way of orienting yourself toward a problem helps differentiate ethical behavior from mere legal compliance; just as the laws governing driving constrain my possible actions but don’t fully determine the contours of my road trip, nor do the laws or regulations governing data collection, storage, and use exhaust the possible decisions you and your team may face.\n",
      "My students lovingly refer to this as \"Anna's red flags” approach—teaching folks to see and address red flags they’d otherwise miss along the way. Of course, orienting yourself toward your work with an eye to ethics is only a starting point. Simply intending to do ethical data science isn’t enough; once you’ve established an orientation, you need information and specialized training.\n",
      "In the case of The Princeton Review, it’s clear that the program designers had a suspicion that they could charge higher prices to customers in wealthier areas. Similarly, the city maps showing Amazon’s same-day delivery areas are immediately recognizable to residents of those cities as showing where people of color live. An awareness of the distribution of wealth and race in the U.S. would have set off alarm bells in either case—but this requires asking at the beginning of a research query “Are we about to build a proxy for race and class with this model?” \n",
      "To return to the road trip analogy, since both my wife and I are Midwestern transplants, we don’t have a deep background and knowledge of California to help guide our journey. Instead, we have to ask for help from folks with more extensive expertise in the space between the Bay Area and Southern California.\n",
      "Similarly, you may have some ideas about data ethics already. You and your team may have even discussed the topic, but you likely don’t have deep knowledge in applied ethics of data or technology, it’s not enough to rely only on your own (necessarily limited) perspective to guide you. Instead, you need to be proactive in reaching out to consult experts in the field, taking advantage of training opportunities when available, and diversifying the range of voices informing your work.\n",

I will highlight the results of a recent survey on machine learning adoption, and along the way describe recent trends in data and machine learning (ML) within companies. This is a good time to assess enterprise activities, as there are many indications a number of companies are already beginning to use machine learning. For example, in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/state-of-machine-learning-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">July 2018 survey</a> that drew more than 11,000 respondents, we found strong engagement among companies: 51% stated they already had machine learning models in production.</p>\n",

      "<p>Consider deep learning, a specific form of machine learning that resurfaced in 2011/2012 due to record-setting models in speech and computer vision. While we continue to read about impressive breakthroughs in speech and computer vision, companies are beginning to use deep learning to augment or replace existing models and algorithms. A famous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/915326707107844097\">example</a> is Google’s machine translation system, which shifted from “stats focused” approaches to TensorFlow. In our own conferences, we see strong interest in training sessions and tutorials on deep learning for time series and natural language processing—two areas where organizations likely already have existing solutions, and for which deep learning is beginning to show some promise.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Machine learning is not only appearing in more products and systems, but as we noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">previous post</a>, ML will also change how applications themselves get built in the future. Developers will find themselves increasingly building software that has ML elements. Thus, many developers will need to curate data, train models, and analyze the results of models. With that said, we are still in a highly empirical era for ML: we need big data, big models, and big compute.</p>\n",

      "<p>With an eye toward the growing importance of machine learning, we recently completed <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/evolving-data-infrastructure.csp\">a data infrastructure survey</a> that drew more than 3,200 respondents. Our goal was twofold: (1) find out what tools and platforms people are using, and (2) determine whether or not companies are building the foundational tools needed to sustain their ML initiatives. Many respondents signaled that they were using open source tools (Apache Spark, Kafka, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) and managed services in the cloud.</p>\n",

      "\t<li>Not surprisingly, data integration and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\">ETL</a> were among the top responses, with 60% currently building or evaluating solutions in this area. In an age of data-hungry algorithms, everything really begins with collecting and aggregating data.</li>\n",
      "\t<li>An important part of getting your data ready for machine learning is to normalize, standardize, and augment it with other data sources. 52% of survey respondents indicated they were building or evaluating solutions for data preparation and cleaning. These include human-in-the-loop systems for data preparation: these are tools that allow domain experts to train automated systems to do data preparation and cleaning at scale. In fact, there is an exciting new research area called <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/software-2-and-snorkel\">data programming</a>, which unifies techniques for the programmatic creation of training sets.</li>\n",
      "\t<li>You also need solutions that let you understand what data you have and who can access it. About a third of the respondents in the survey indicated they are interested in data governance systems and data catalogs. Some companies are beginning to build their own solutions, and several will be presenting them at Strata Data in NYC this coming Fall—e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez\">Marquez</a> (WeWork) and <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/databook/\">Databook</a> (Uber). But this is also an area where startups—Alation, Immuta, Okera, and others—are beginning to develop interesting offerings.</li>\n",
      "\t<li>21% of survey respondents said they are building or evaluating data lineage solutions. In the past, we got by with a casual attitude toward data sources. Discussions of data ethics, privacy, and security have made data scientists aware of the importance of data lineage and provenance. Specifically, companies will need to know where the data comes from, how it was gathered, and how it was modified along the way. The need to audit or reproduce ML pipelines is increasingly a legal and security issue. Fortunately, we are beginning to see open source projects (including <a href=\"https://github.com/iterative/dvc\">DVC</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pachyderm\">Pachyderm</a>, <a href=\"https://delta.io/\">Delta Lake</a>, <a href=\"https://www.liquidata.co/#products\">DOLT</a>) that address the need for data lineage and provenance.

      "\t<li>As the number of data scientists and machine learning engineers grow within an organization, tools have to be standardized, models and features need to be shared, and automation starts getting introduced. 58% of survey respondents indicated they are building or evaluating data science platforms. Our Strata Data conference consistently features several sessions on how companies built their internal data science platforms, specifically in regard to what tradeoffs and design choices they made, and what lessons they’ve learned along the way.</li>\n",

      " <p>To make that vision a reality, we need to start with some heavy lifting on the back end. Who are your customers? Do you really know who they are? All customers leave behind a data trail, but that data trail is a series of fragments, and it’s hard to relate those fragments to each other. If one customer has multiple accounts, can you tell? If a customer has separate accounts for business and personal use, can you link them? And if an organization uses many different names (we remember a presentation in which someone talked of the hundreds of names—literally—that resolved to IBM), can you discover the single organization responsible for them? Customer experience starts with knowing exactly who your customers are and how they’re related. Scrubbing your customer lists to eliminate duplicates is called entity resolution; it used to be the domain of large companies that could afford substantial data teams. We’re now seeing the democratization of entity resolution: there are now <a href=\"https://senzing.com/\">startups</a> that provide entity resolution software and services that are appropriate for small to mid-sized organizations.</p>\r\n",

Many hybrid recommenders rely on many different sources and large amounts of data, and deep learning models are frequently part of such systems. While it’s common for recommendations to be based on models that are only retrained periodically, advanced recommendation and personalization systems will need to be real time. Using reinforcement learning, online learning, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/machine-learning-for-personalization\">bandit algorithms</a>, companies are beginning to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray\">build recommendation systems</a> that constantly train models against live data.</p>\r\n",

So far, chatbots are more annoying than helpful—though, well-designed, simple “frequently asked question” bots can lead to good customer acquisition rates. But we’re only in the early stages of natural language processing and understanding—and in the past year, we’ve seen <a href=\"https://www.topbots.com/most-important-ai-nlp-research/\">many breakthroughs</a>. As our ability to build sophisticated language models improves, we will see <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">chatbots progress through a number of </a><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-next-generation-of-ai-assistants-in-enterprise\">stages</a>: from providing notifications, to managing simple question and answer scenarios, to understanding context and participating in simple dialogs, and finally to personal assistants that are “aware” of their users’ needs. As chatbots improve, we expect them to become an integral part of customer service, not merely an annoyance that you have to work through to get to a human. And for chatbots to reach this level of performance, they will need to incorporate real-time recommendation and personalization. They will need to understand customers as well as a human.</p>\r\n",

Fraud is no longer person-to-person: it is automated, as in a bot that buys up all the tickets to events so they can be resold by scalpers. As we’ve seen in many recent elections, it is easy for criminals to penetrate social media by creating a bot that floods conversations with automated responses. It is much harder to discover those bots and block them in real time. That’s only possible with machine learning, and even then, it’s a difficult problem that’s only partially solved.

It might well make it harder for Facebook to work on those problems.</em></p><p>Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, recently wrote an opinion piece for the <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">presenting an argument for breaking up Facebook</a>. I was trying to stay out of this discussion, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/facebook-nick-clegg-chris-hughes.html\">Nick Clegg's response</a> pretty much summed up my opinions. But I got one too many emails from friends that simply assumed I'd be in agreement with Chris, especially given <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">my critique of blitzscaling</a> and Silicon Valley's obsession with \"world domination.\"</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>If Facebook should be broken up, it should be on grounds of anticompetitive behavior, and Chris barely even touches on that topic. Dragging in the history of all Facebook's various corporate missteps <em>for which a breakup would provide no remedy</em> just muddies the water and lets everyone think that punishment has been done. It's actually a way of NOT solving the actual problems. Breaking up Facebook won't solve the disinformation problem. It won't solve the privacy problem. It might well make it harder for Facebook to work on those problems.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In addition, if harm to our society is sufficient reason for a breakup, there are a lot of companies ahead of Facebook in the queue. Big banks. The pharma companies that brought us the opioid crisis. The energy cartel that's still fighting against responding to climate change 70 years after the warning bells were sounded.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Even if you restrict yourself to surveillance capitalism, picking out one high-profile malefactor, issuing draconian punishment, and then going back to business as usual everywhere else is a lose-lose, not a win. Facebook is not at the root of this problem, nor even the worst offender. To solve this problem, we need to look not only beyond Facebook, but also beyond the entire tech industry. Banks and telcos are often worse privacy offenders than Google or Facebook. And if you restrict yourself to harm from disinformation, polarization, and radicalization, Twitter and YouTube are just as culpable and, out of the spotlight, appear to be doing less than Facebook to police their problems. Reddit is far worse, and traditional media outlets, especially the Fox News empire, almost as bad.

      "\r\n",
      "<p>What's wrong with this infographic? It lists all of Facebook's properties, including those that are primarily messaging, while limiting the competition purely to social media, and failing to include other messaging products. Take out WhatsApp and Messenger, and Facebook suddenly doesn't look so big. Or add in other messaging products from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and plain old SMS, and again, suddenly Facebook doesn't look so dominant. Add in Google's other properties besides YouTube, especially those like search and the new newsfeed on Android phones that influence what people see and understand about the world. Restrict it to the individual national markets where the competition actually happens, and it would look different again. This isn't analysis. This is polemics.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>I'm not saying there aren't grounds for investigation of anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry, or by Facebook specifically, but if someone's going to talk breakup, I'd love to see reporting and opinion pieces that make a true antitrust case, if there is one.</p>\r\n",

It’s time they built some for themselves.</em></p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-last-breakthrough-in-computer-programming\">Quora post</a>, Alan Kay lamented the state of tooling for programmers. Every other engineering discipline has built modern computational tools: for computer aided design, simulation and testing, and for manufacturing. But programming hasn’t progressed significantly since the 1970s. We’ve built great tools for others, but not ourselves. The shoemaker’s children have holes in their shoes.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Kay isn’t being entirely fair, but before looking at what he’s missing, it’s important to think about how he’s right. If we don’t understand how he’s right, we certainly won’t understand what to build next, and where the future may be staring us in the face.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Let’s start with programming itself. We’re still using punch cards, now emulated on modern high-resolution monitors. We’re still doing line-oriented programming with an alpha-numeric character set. We’re still using programming languages that, for the most part, behave like C or like LISP, and the biggest debates in the programming community are about which of these ancient paradigms is better. We have IDEs that make it somewhat easier to generate those virtual punch cards, but don’t fundamentally change the nature of the beast. We have some tools for unit testing, but they work by requiring us to write more punch cards (unit tests). We have version control tools for managing changes to those punch cards. And we even have tools for continuous integration, continuous deployment, and container orchestration—all of which are programmed by creating more virtual punch cards.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Database developers are in somewhat better shape. Non-procedural languages like SQL lend themselves more readily to visual programming styles, yielding tools like <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/\">Tableau</a>, though those tools don't help much if you're connecting an enterprise application to a back-end database.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Where can we go from here? I’ve long thought that the real next-generation programming language won’t be a rehash of LISP, C, or Smalltalk syntax. It won’t be character based at all: it will be visual. Rather than typing, we’ll draw what we want. I’ve yet to see a language that fits the bill. Teaching platforms like <a href=\"https://www.alice.org/\">Alice</a> and <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/\">Scratch</a> are an interesting attempt, but they don’t go anywhere near far enough: they just take the programming languages we already know and apply a visual metaphor. A C-clamp instead of a loop. Plug-together blocks instead of keywords. Nothing has really changed.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>I suspect that the visual programming language we need will borrow ideas from all of our programming paradigms: it will pass messages, it will have objects, it will support concurrency, and so on. What it won’t have is a textual representation; it won’t be a visual sugarcoating to an underlying language like C.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>I have some ideas about where such a language might come from. I see two trends that might help us think about the future of programming.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>First, I see increasing evidence that there are two kinds of programmers: programmers who build things by connecting other things together, and programmers who create the things that others connect together. The first is the “blue collar” group of programmers; the second is the “academic” group of programmers–for example, the people doing new work in AI. Neither group is more valuable or important than the other. Building trades provide a good analogy. If I need to install a new kitchen sink, I call a plumber. He knows how to connect the sink to the rest of the plumbing; he doesn’t know how to design the sink. There’s a sink designer in an office somewhere who probably understands (in a rudimentary way) how to connect the sink to the plumbing, but whose real expertise is designing sinks, not installing them. You can’t do without either, though the world needs more plumbers than designers. The same holds true for software: the number of people who build web applications is far greater than the number of people who build web frameworks like React or who design new algorithms and do fundamental research.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Should the computational plumber use the same tools as the algorithm designer? I don’t think so; I can imagine a language that is highly optimized for connecting pre-built operations, but not for building the operations themselves. You can see a glimpse of this in languages that apply functions to every element of a list: you no longer need loops. (Python’s map() applies a function to every element of a list; there are languages where functions behave like this automatically.) You can see PHP as a language that’s good for connecting web pages to databases, but horrible for implementing cryptographic algorithms. And perhaps this connective language might be visual: if we’re just connecting a bunch of things, why not use lines rather than lines of code? (Mel Conway is working on “<a href=\"http://melconway.com/talks/2019_consumer_apps/11.html\">wiring diagrams</a>” that allow consumers to build applications by describing interaction scenarios.)</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Second, one of the most interesting research areas in artificial intelligence is the ability to generate code. A couple of years ago, we saw that AI was capable of optimizing database queries. Andrej Karpathy has argued that this ability places us on the edge of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35\">Software 2.0</a>, in which AI will generate the algorithms we need. If, in the future, AI systems will be able to write our code, what kind of language will we need to describe the code we want? That language certainly won’t be a language with loops and conditionals; nor do I think it will be a language based on the mathematical abstraction given by functions. Karpathy suggests that the core of this language will be tagged datasets for training AI models. Instead of writing step-by-step instructions, we will show the computer what we want it to do. If you think such a programming paradigm is too radical, too far away from the process of making a machine do your bidding, think about what the machine language programmers of the 1950s would think about a modern optimizing compiler.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>So, while I can’t yet imagine what a new visual language will look like, I can sense that we’re on the edge of being able to build it. In fact, we’re building it already. One of Jeremy Howard’s <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ca/public/schedule/detail/72031\">projects</a> at <a href=\"https://platform.ai/\">platform.ai</a> is a system that allows subject matter experts to build machine learning applications without any traditional programming. And Microsoft has launched a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/microsoft-launches-a-drag-and-drop-machine-learning-tool-and-hosted-jupyter-notebooks/\">drag-and-drop machine learning tool</a> that provides a graphical tool for assembling training data, cleaning it, and using it to build a model without any traditional programming. I suppose one could argue that this “isn’t real programming,” but that’s tantamount to defining programming by its dependence on archaic tools.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>What about the rest? What about the tools for building, testing, deploying, and managing software? Here’s where Kay underestimates what we have. I’d agree that it isn’t much, but it’s something; it’s a foundation that we can build upon. We have more than 40 years of experience with build tools (starting with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)\">make</a> in 1976), and similar experience with automated configuration (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine\">CFengine</a>, the precursor to Chef and Puppet, goes back to the ‘90s), network monitoring (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagios\">Nagios</a> dates back to 2002), and continuous integration (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_(software)\">Hudson</a>, predecessor of Jeeves, dates to 2005). Kubernetes, which handles container orchestration, is the “new kid on the block.” Kubernetes is the robotically automated factory for distributed systems. It’s a tool for managing and operating large software deployments, running across many nodes. That’s really a complete tool suite that runs from automated assembly through automated testing to fully automated production. Lights off; let the computers do the work.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Sadly, these tools are still configured with virtual punch cards (text files, usually in XML, YAML, JSON, or something equally unpleasant), and that’s a problem that has to be overcome. I think the problem isn’t difficulty–creating a visual language for any of these tools strikes me as significantly easier than creating a visual language for programming–it’s tradition.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Software people are used to bad tools. And while we’d hate being forced to use physical punch cards (I’ve done that, it’s no fun), if you virtualize those punch cards, we’re just fine. Perhaps it’s a rite of passage, a sort of industrial hazing. “We survived this suckage, you should too if you’re going to be a real programmer.” We’re happy with that.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Kay is right that we shouldn’t be happy with this state of affairs. The pain of building software using tools that would be immediately understandable to developers in the 1960s keeps us thinking about the bits, rather than the meaning of those bits. As an industry, we need to get beyond that. We have prototypes for some of the tools we need. We just need to finish the job.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>We need to imagine a different future for software development.</p>\r\n",

The only real question is what we're going to get out of it. Will we be able to put it to use effectively? Will we find appropriate uses for it?</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Now that AI is moving out of the laboratory and into offices and homes, a number of questions are more important than ever. What kinds of tools will make it easier to build AI and ML systems? How will we make AI safe for humans? And what kinds of systems will augment human capabilities, rather than replace them? In short, as <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/is-ai-human-ready\">Aleksander Madry said in his talk</a>, we are now at AI 1.0. How do we get to AI 2.0?</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Madry emphasized the importance of making AI ready for us: secure, reliable, ethical, and understandable. It's easy to see the shortcomings of AI now. Madry showed how easy it was to turn a pig into a jet by adding noise, or to become a movie star by changing your glasses. Getting to the next step won't be easy: training models will probably become more difficult, and those models may be more complex. We might need even more training data than we need now; and currently, one of the biggest barriers to widespread use of AI is the lack of training data. But the work that it takes to get to AI 2.0 will benefit us. We'll never have AI systems that don't make mistakes; but mistakes will be fewer, and they'll be more like the mistakes that humans make, rather than mistakes that are nonsensical. No more flying pigs. And that commonality might make it easier for those systems to work alongside us.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>We saw many new tools for building AI systems: tools designed to make building these systems easier, allowing subject experts to play a bigger role. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/automated-ml-a-journey-from-crisperml-to-azure-ml\">Danielle Dean of Microsoft showed</a> how they built a recommendation system for machine learning pipelines; it sampled the space of possible pipelines and made recommendations about which to try. This approach drastically reduced the \"trial and error\" loop that characterizes a lot of AI development.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Stanford's <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/software-2-and-snorkel\">Chris Ré demonstrated Snorkel</a>, an open source tool for automating the process of tagging training data. An AI system has three components: a model, training data, and hardware. Advanced hardware for building AI systems is getting faster and cheaper; it's becoming a commodity. So are models: systems like <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/automated-ml-a-journey-from-crisperml-to-azure-ml\">Dean's</a>, or like <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/making-real-world-distributed-deep-learning-easy-with-nauta\">Intel's Nauta</a>, simplify and democratize the task of building models. Training data is the one component that stubbornly resists commoditization. Acquiring and labeling data is labor intensive. Researchers have used low-cost labor from Mechanical Turk (or grad students) to label data, or gathered pre-labeled data from online sites like Flickr. But those approaches won't work in industry. Can we use AI to eliminate most of the work of tagging and turn it into a relatively simple programming problem? It looks like we can; if Ré is right, Snorkel and tools like it are a big step toward AI 2.0.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>We saw many glimpses of the future. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/decoding-the-human-genome-with-deep-learning\">Olga Troyanska showed</a> how deep learning is helping to decode the most difficult parts of the human genome: the logic that controls gene expression and, hence, cell differentiation. There are many diseases we know are genetic; we just don't know what parts of the genome are responsible. We will only be able to diagnose and treat those diseases when we understand how the language of DNA works.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>CMU's <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-the-robotics-revolution\">Martial Hebert's lab is taking AI into the human world</a> by building systems that can reason about intent. If we want robots that can assist people, they need to be able to understand and predict human behavior in real time. He demonstrated how an AI system can help a paralyzed person perform tasks that would otherwise be impossible—but only by reasoning about intent. Without this understanding, without knowing the goal was to pick up something or to open a door, the system was only able to twitch uselessly. All of this reasoning has to happen in hard real time: an autonomous vehicle needs to be able to predict whether a person will stand on the curb or run into the street, and it needs to do so with enough time to apply the brakes if needed.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Any conference on AI needs to recognize the extraordinary messes and problems that automation can create. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/computational-propaganda\">Sean Gourley of Primer talked about the arms race in disinformation</a>. In the past year, we've gained the ability to create realistic images of fake people, and we've made tremendous progress in generating realistic language. We won't be able to handle these growing threats without the assistance of AI. Andrew Zaldivar talked about work at Google Jigsaw that tries to detect online abuse and harassment. Kurt Mehmel from Dataiku talked about progress toward ethical artificial intelligence, a goal we will only reach if we build teams that are radically inclusive. The saying goes, \"with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow\"; but that's only true if those eyes are all different eyes, looking at problems in different ways. The solution isn't to build better technology; rather, it's making sure the people most likely to be impacted by the technology are included at all steps of the process.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The conference sessions covered everything from advanced AI techniques in reinforcement learning and natural language processing to business applications, to deploying AI applications at scale. AI is quickly moving beyond the hype: it's becoming part of the everyday working world. But as <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/is-ai-human-ready\">Aleksander Madry said</a>, we need to make AI human-ready. We need to get to AI 2.0.

In particular, patterns around cloud native components helped drive support for the Next Architecture, as we note in this <a href=\"http://oreilly.com/ideas/3-emerging-trends-tech-leaders-should-watch#next-architecture\">report</a>.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>Adopting a cloud native infrastructure is both complex and difficult, which is made clear from the survey results showing at least 40% of respondents citing challenges with finding skilled engineers, migrating from legacy architecture, responding to security and compliance demands, managing technical infrastructure, and transforming their corporate culture (Figure 11).</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>That lack of skills is a much bigger factor than hiring shows respondents are trying to adopt cloud native on their own—a sign that organizations are fundamentally structuring themselves around cloud native architectures, not looking to hire that skill from outside. We see in Figure 12 that early respondents struggle significantly more with lack of skills and company culture than the other categories, suggesting these are issues organizations should consider tackling first when adopting cloud native.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In that same vein, as organizations restructure internal processes and pipelines to adopt a cloud native architecture, they struggle to put a corporate culture in place that supports this new way of working. Cloud native adoption isn’t just about using the right tools or having the right technical infrastructure (though, those are important). Adopting a DevOps workflow that breaks down the barriers between teams and embraces a culture of collaboration is essential to implementing a successful cloud native architecture that relies on continuous integration, delivery, and improvement.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>And finally, security and compliance hurdles are not going away, even if they are less prevalent than a few years ago, when health data and financial regulations limited what many organizations could even consider placing in the cloud. While some of those hurdles have been resolved, our respondents tell us that security and compliance continue to require attention when considering cloud native implementations.</p>\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "<p>It’s telling, though, when looking at the responses in the context of maturity, the more sophisticated cohort said they depend on site reliability engineering (SRE) to manage their cloud native infrastructure (Figure 14). SRE is a practice started at Google where engineers take on both development and operations responsibilities to release software faster and more reliably. SREs split their time between developing and maintaining infrastructure by automating repetitive tasks (toil) to allow time to build new features. While DevOps is a set of principles that loosely define how teams should work together to remove silos and collaborate effectively, SRE serves as an implementation of DevOps and is a job role that will see increased demand as organizations continue their transitions to cloud native.</p>\r\n",

Orchestration and containers, combined with the cloud and microservices, form the technical foundation of the Next Architecture.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The percentages around service mesh and serverless were lower, likely because these technologies are relatively immature (Figure 15). However, it’s worth briefly outlining how they work and why they’re poised for adoption because we expect both tools to play large future roles in the cloud native space.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>A service mesh is a configurable, low-latency infrastructure layer designed to ease the complexity of networking microservices and managing communication between them in large, distributed networks. Istio, arguably the most popular service mesh, was developed by Google, Lyft, and IBM as an open source solution, and only reached version 1.0 in July 2018. We’ll see more organizations turning to service mesh infrastructure as the tools mature and expanding organizations seek solutions for scaling their systems and managing the increasing complexity that comes with a global, distributed network.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>While service mesh provides networking infrastructure, serverless provides another layer of abstraction for cloud developers. Despite the name, serverless does not mean there are no servers. Serverless architecture simply puts the onus of managing backend infrastructure on the cloud provider so developers can focus on building applications rather than the software that powers them. Serverless architecture is generally stateless, provisions resources on demand, and only incurs cost for the resources actually used, potentially enabling organizations to scale rapidly while saving money. However, the technology still has significant drawbacks, as outlined in a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03383.pdf\">recent study by the University of California at Berkeley</a>, including inadequate storage, and performance and security concerns. But you can expect to see these issues resolved within the next decade. As serverless matures, Berkeley researchers predict it will “become the default computing paradigm for the Cloud Era, largely replacing serverful computing and thereby bringing an end to the Cloud-Server Era.”</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The survey results also reveal a story around cloud native experience and tool adoption (Figure 16). Sophisticated cloud native organizations are in a position to iteratively improve and move into tools like service mesh and serverless. Organizations new to cloud native may need to wait and learn before they can fully harness some of these tools.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>In Figure 18, it’s surprising to see 27% of respondents work at organizations with no plans for cloud native adoption. While we can’t determine exactly why they have no plans, it seems prudent to investigate cloud native even if the adoption timeline for your organization will be long.

      "\r\n",
      "<p>When evaluating responses from the sophisticated cohort, a few lessons emerge for organizations considering cloud native and those that are in the early stages of cloud native implementations:</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<ul>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Cloud native success comes empirically. Don’t try to overhaul your entire architecture at once. Start small and focus on high-impact services that show clear value to build internal support for investing in the ongoing transition.</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>It’s best to manage expectations. Focus on learning from, and building on, your early cloud native efforts.</li>\r\n",
      "\t<li>Take advantage of training opportunities, including social learning via conferences where you can gain access to best practices from those with the most cloud native experience.</li>\r\n",
      "</ul>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>More generally, as companies rise to meet the increasingly real-time demands of users and customers, and the need to respond to nimble competitors, we expect organizations to find the cloud native approach a necessity. Cloud native makes it possible for companies to deploy features faster, more affordably, more reliably, and with less risk. As the cloud native market develops, we see many opportunities for tools and training to help ease the transition to new architectures and to bridge the cloud native skills gap.</p>\r\n",

      "<p>A cryptocurrency-based contender that has appeared in order to solve this crisis is called a stablecoin. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged by various means to a traditional fiat currency to maintain its price or is backed by precious metals and other commodities. To date, there have been stablecoins backed by fiat currencies in reserve, gold, and even cryptocurrency itself. Although some have failed and lost their desired peg, recent iterations have proven quite successful so far in their stability.</p>\r\n",

In 2017, the revenue opportunities exceeded $1.9 trillion, trending double-digit percentage growth per year. While cryptocurrencies have many desirable properties for digital payments, such as low transaction fees, asset transfer simplicity, and auditability, the price volatility of mainstream cryptocurrencies is currently untenable for production use cases.

Although both failed due to collateralization instability, they paved the way for new iterations that learned from their mistakes as well as strengthened the case for a price-stable asset represented as a cryptocurrency.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The first implementation of a reserved back stablecoin came in late 2014 from Tether, which was initially built on Bitcoin through the Omni layer. Although Tether offered the creation and redemption process typically associated with reserve backed stablecoins, its lack of transparency paved the way for transparent reserve backed stablecoins such as CENTRE’s USDC and Gemini’s GUSD.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>There are, in fact, three types of stablecoin implementations: reserve backed, crypto collateralized, and algorithmic, each with its own associated risks and tradeoffs. While reserve backed implementations provide transparency and absolute stability from natural arbitrage opportunities, there is added counterparty risk from the centralized controller. Crypto collateralized implementations forego counterparty risk at the expense of the volatility from their underlying collateral. Algorithmic stablecoins are dependent on incentive mechanisms and speculation, and haven’t had a proven implementation yet. However, all three are interesting in their approaches and allow users to gauge their comfort in using their choice of asset.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>Stablecoin implementation types</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h3>Reserve backed</h3>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>A reserve backed stablecoin is one that is typically issued by a central provider and is backed 1:1 to a fiat currency by means of both a tokenization and redemption process. To generate new tokens, customers send collateral to the provider, and the provider then mints or creates new tokens. The provider typically has the underlying collateral under custody with regular attestation reports, and “burns” or removes the tokens from circulation once they are redeemed.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Recent examples of reserve backed stablecoins include Gemini’s GUSD, CENTRE’s USDC, and Paxos’ PAX. Legacy reserve backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) has suffered much scrutiny due to the provider’s lack of regular auditing of the underlying collateral. However, the latest class of reserve backed stablecoins have been consistently providing audit reports from reputable firms.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Reserve backed stablecoins typically retain their peg from arbitrage cycles. For example, if Gemini’s GUSD is trading under $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to buy the asset until it stabilizes and redeem the tokens for the underlying collateral, thereby making a profit. If the asset is trading over $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to send collateral to Gemini in order to generate new tokens and sell them for the higher rate.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Typically in these systems, there’s an increased counterparty risk due to the ability of the central provider to freeze assets at any time. This issue came up recently with <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/winklevoss-crypto-gemini-gusd-stablecoin-redemption\">Gemini customers having redemption issues</a>.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h3>Crypto collateralized</h3>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>A crypto collateralized stablecoin is one that has cryptocurrency as its underlying collateral and uses price feeds associated with the collateral as a means of keeping the stablecoin at one dollar. In the case of crypto collateralized stablecoins, plenty of projects have made the attempt at stabilizing a system, but none have succeeded as much as MakerDAO.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Originally launched in 2017, DAI, the crypto collateralized stablecoin from the MakerDAO project, has remained relatively stable with continued development interest. Currently, DAI is collateralized by Ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, and the project plans on utilizing other assets for collateral in the future. Users wishing to obtain DAI must first lock ETH in a “CDP,” or collateralized debt position. Due to the high volatility of ETH, DAI is typically overcollateralized at rates well over 100%.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>If an individual’s CDP is ever close to being insolvent, the system triggers the sale of the user’s underlying collateral. If the system ever becomes insolvent due to a market crash in the price of the underlying collateral, Maker or “MKR,” the other token in the MakerDAO system, acts as a buyer of last resort where new MKR tokens are minted, effectively diluting current holders, and sold on the open market as a means of stabilizing the system.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>MKR holders are responsible for voting on resolutions and regulating the entire system through MakerDAO’s governance mechanisms. A fee in MKR is also paid to open CDPs to acquire DAI, effectively reducing the supply as more are opened.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Currently, the key centralized aspect with the most risk in MakerDAO’s system is its oracles that generate price feeds for the underlying collateral. Other centralized actors include “keepers,” or automated market makers that keep DAI around its target price. Considering limited arbitrage opportunities on a redemption process such as DAIs, external mechanisms such as these must be consulted to maintain stability.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h3>Algorithmic</h3>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The last major implementation of stablecoins is based on algorithms that trigger supply inflation and deflation in relation to the stablecoin’s target price. Algorithmic stablecoins aren’t backed by collateral, but rather have speculators involved with associated secondary and tertiary assets to keep the system balanced.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Algorithmic stablecoins are typically reliant on an elastic supply scheme building on Robert Sam’s Seigniorage Shares, where a base stable-asset is produced, but secondary and even tertiary assets generated and redeemed to ensure system stability. Seigniorage generally involves profiting from the creation of currency; the difference in the cost of the production of money and the money itself. In an algorithmic system, speculation on the secondary and tertiary assets to keep an algorithmic system stable is designed to yield a profit. One recent example of an attempt at creating such a system was Basis, a project seeking to build an algorithmic model that recently refunded investors.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The Basis model included three tokens: a stablecoin to retain its peg at one dollar, and “bonds” and “shares” that act as the secondary and tertiary assets. Bonds are created by the system during periods of price decline under the desired peg and are purchased using the stablecoin to deflate its supply and increase its price. The bonds are immediately redeemed once the price reaches above its target of $1. Shares act as a hedge on a healthy system, as shareholders are granted newly minted stablecoins if all bonds have been redeemed and the stablecoin continues to trade above $1. The inflation mechanism of the stablecoin is meant to drive the price down, as shareholders are granted tokens from it.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>To date, no algorithmic stablecoin has launched successfully. The next attempt at an algorithmic stablecoin launch will likely come from Carbon, and their CUSD stablecoin. At the moment, Carbon is fully collateralized by U.S. dollars held in bank accounts, but they plan on eventually transitioning to an alternative system.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>A plethora of implementations</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>There is no shortage of projects wishing to issue stablecoins, as it has become quite a hot topic in recent times. To date, there are more than a dozen launched stablecoin projects with more continually being developed to serve different purposes. Most of them have been pegged to the U.S. dollar, but there are a few examples being collateralized by other fiat currencies and commodities. The most notable of which is Digix—which is backed by gold held in a custodial vault. Being able to leverage cost savings internally to an existing ecosystem is one of the primary use cases for institutions and enterprise companies to partner with or create their own stablecoin.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Last year, in particular, saw a dramatic rise in the number of reserved backed stablecoins that launched. Businesses such as Paxos, Gemini, and Circle saw the benefits of launching these assets and have since been building lofty ecosystems around their respective assets. They have also set the standard in regular auditing, providing attestation reports for each asset on a regular basis. This further lowers the risk profile of these assets while providing a safety mechanism to encourage originally skeptic outsiders to finally enter and interface with these technologies.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>Volatility mitigation in production</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>In order to reap the benefits of stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) services are beginning to accept stablecoins as a means of interfacing with services. DeFi services are those that provide traditional financial services while ensuring transactions are protected, peer to peer, and that users retain custody of their assets at all times. Examples of these services include exchanges, automated asset management funds, and debt platforms.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>One example of such a service is <a href=\"https://dharma.io/\">Dharma </a>—a suite of decentralized lending products. Dharma’s main product involves peer-to-peer lending where users can collateralize their cryptocurrencies in exchange for Ethereum or USDC—a stablecoin. This would allow risk to be averted, as the recipient would be able to avoid market volatility upon receiving a stablecoin. Even <a href=\"https://blockfi.com/\">BlockFi</a>, a competitor to Dharma, recently announced the integration of GUSD on their platform to help users avoid volatility.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Decentralized exchanges have also taken note of stablecoins and have continually added them as an available asset for trading. For example, <a href=\"https://blog.ethfinex.com/announcing-dai-integration-da1484ed86f/\">Ethfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ddex/ddex-makerdao-an-intro-to-decentralized-leveraged-trading-f76995fd9239\">DDex</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-network-lists-its-first-stablecoin-20fb6ba35d6\">Kyber Network</a> have all listed DAI on their exchanges in order to better assist new traders and those who need to exchange assets and avoid risk after liquidation. Even seasoned traders can now use DAI in order to hedge risk in short-term market fluctuations and benefit from its stability.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>There are a number of additional projects in the process of launching this year, including MelonPort, an asset management protocol, and Origin, a marketplace generation protocol that will also accept stablecoins as a way to mitigate volatility risk. The increase in stablecoin adoption is a positive signaling mechanism that is demonstrating a natural fit. As more decentralized applications and protocols continue to be developed, stablecoins will naturally serve as a transactional asset to greatly benefit end users.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<h2>Mass proliferation, or “One to Rule Them All”</h2>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The recent announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments\">JPM Coin</a>, a stablecoin by J.P. Morgan (which clearly demonstrates an institutional interest in the space), is going to usher in a wave of stablecoins in the next few years. These assets will range from other sovereign-backed fiat currencies such as the Yuan, Yen, and Euro, to other traditional commodities such as precious metals and rare earth minerals. However, their implementations will definitely take note of current iterations that provide a regular price peg free from value fluctuation (if a fiat currency), the least amount of risk for users.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The reasoning is that in the short to medium term, stablecoins provide an entrance toward a new financial system. Through this stable onramp into blockchain systems, users need not worry about market volatility when thinking about traditional payments, nor do they need to worry about open platform access being rescinded due to a market downturn. They provide predictability in price and provide a way to sideline funds during market swings without having to pay additional fees moving back into fiat.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>It is unlikely in the long term that there will be as many stablecoins as are currently available and being developed. While there won’t be a single controlling stablecoin due to the myriad of assets they could be pegged to, there will be a basket that commands a majority of the trading volume. Even with all of its historical issues, Tether still commands a vast majority of trading volume relative to other stablecoins simply because of its social relativity and continued redemption and minting arbitrage opportunities. Competition will drive pricing down and force the technology to grow quickly, but will also result in low or negative margins for the firms producing these but not operating at efficient enough scale.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>The other inherent risk is to consider if and when cryptocurrencies reach a sufficiently high market capitalization and trading interest. Once enough volume reaches traditional medium of exchange (MoE) cryptocurrencies, prices may begin to plateau and stabilize due to a lack of illiquidity. If Bitcoin were to reach over a sufficient amount of trading volume, having a daily price fluctuation of 10%+ would be highly unlikely, lessening the value proposition of stablecoins. However, stablecoins for the foreseeable future will continue to provide a key stability mechanism by way of the policy and monetary controls we are starting to see implemented in some popular stablecoins today.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>Allowing stablecoins to have monetary controls in place allows not just users but regulators and institutional entities to have a comfortable experience with a traditionally volatile asset class. Enterprises didn’t jump right into cloud computing, and to this day most still have at least some of their processes run locally—this will most likely be the same case for stablecoins and their adoption. Facebook has recently been <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-21/facebook-is-said-to-develop-stablecoin-for-whatsapp-transfers\">noted to be working on</a> a stablecoin with their WhatsApp messenger and have been testing it in India. This allows them to govern the monetary policy inside of their apps and build pathways into and out of their ecosystems. Not only does this allow them to save on transaction fees associated with more traditional systems, but it also allows them to guarantee stability in their walled gardens while using cryptocurrency. Facebook being an already digitally native company allows them to test the cost savings aspects while also complying with various regulatory requirements for their users across geographic lines.</p>\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "<p>As the stablecoin ecosystem continues to grow between enterprise players and existing blockchain ecosystem players such as Gemini and Coinbase, users will continue to have the freedom and flexibility to transition between fiat and crypto seamlessly, and more importantly, be granted the stability needed to avoid cryptocurrency’s current volatility crisis.</p>\r\n",

On one hand, it significantly increases attrition, with one near miss predicting more than a 10% chance of disappearing permanently from the NIH system. Yet, despite an early setback, individuals with near misses systematically outperformed those with near wins in the longer run, as their publications in the next 10 years garnered substantially higher impact. We further find that this performance advantage seems to go beyond a screening mechanism, whereby a more selected fraction of near-miss applicants remained than the near winners, suggesting that early-career setback appears to cause a performance improvement among those who persevere. Overall, the findings are consistent with the concept that \"what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.\"</i>\r\n",

I will highlight the results of a recent survey on machine learning adoption, and along the way describe recent trends in data and machine learning (ML) within companies. This is a good time to assess enterprise activities, as there are many indications a number of companies are already beginning to use machine learning. For example, in a July 2018 survey that drew more than 11,000 respondents, we found strong engagement among companies: 51% stated they already had machine learning models in production. We found that companies that have successfully adopted machine learning do so either by building on existing data products and services, or by modernizing existing models and algorithms.

In our own conferences, we see strong interest in training sessions and tutorials on deep learning for time series and natural language processing—two areas where organizations likely already have existing solutions, and for which deep learning is beginning to show some promise. Data is key to machine learning applications, and getting data flowing, cleaned, and in usable form is going to be key to sustaining a machine learning practice. Many respondents signaled that they were using open source tools (Apache Spark, Kafka, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) 52% of survey respondents indicated they were building or evaluating solutions for data preparation and cleaning. 21% of survey respondents said they are building or evaluating data lineage solutions. Fortunately, we are beginning to see open source projects (including DVC, Pachyderm, Delta Lake, DOLT) that address the need for data lineage and provenance. As the number of data scientists and machine learning engineers grow within an organization, tools have to be standardized, models and features need to be shared, and automation starts getting introduced. 58% of survey respondents indicated they are building or evaluating data science platforms.

      "\t5G is beginning to be rolled out, and 5G will lead to the development of machine-to-machine applications, many of which will incorporate ML. Specialized hardware for machine learning (specifically, deep learning) will come online: we are already seeing new hardware for model inference for edge devices and servers. Sometime in Q3/Q4 of 2019, specialized hardware for training deep learning models will become available. Imagine systems that will let data scientists and machine learning experts run experiments at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the time. This new generation of specialized hardware for machine learning training and inference will allow data scientists to explore and deploy many new types of models. Machine learning engineers sit between data science and engineering/ops, they tend to be higher paid than data scientists, and they generally have stronger technical and programming skills. Model development tools like MLflow are catching on. Another signal that interest in ML is increasing emerges when you look at the traction of new projects like MLflow: in just about 10 months since it launched, we already see strong interest from many companies. As we noted in a previous post, a common use case for MLflow is experiment tracking and management—before MLflow, there weren’t good open source tools for this. In speaking with many companies that have built data platforms and infrastructure for machine learning, a few important factors arise that have to be taken into account as you design your toolchain:\n",

Just like data are assets that require specialized tools (including data governance solutions and data catalogs), models are also valuable assets that will need to be managed and protected. As we noted in a previous post, tools for model governance and model operations will also be increasingly critical: the next big step in the democratization of machine learning is making it more manageable.\n",

In recent years, hybrid recommender systems—applications that combine multiple recommender strategies—have become much more common. Many hybrid recommenders rely on many different sources and large amounts of data, and deep learning models are frequently part of such systems.

Using reinforcement learning, online learning, and bandit algorithms, companies are beginning to build recommendation systems that constantly train models against live data. Machine learning and AI are automating many different enterprise tasks and workflows, including customer interactions. So far, chatbots are more annoying than helpful—though, well-designed, simple “frequently asked question” bots can lead to good customer acquisition rates. As our ability to build sophisticated language models improves, we will see chatbots progress through a number of stages: from providing notifications, to managing simple question and answer scenarios, to understanding context and participating in simple dialogs, and finally to personal assistants that are “aware” of their users’ needs. None of these challenges are simple, but technology won’t improve customer experience if customers end up feeling abused. The result may be more efficient, but that’s a bad tradeoff.\n",

      "Programmers have built great tools for others. Every other engineering discipline has built modern computational tools: for computer aided design, simulation and testing, and for manufacturing. We’ve built great tools for others, but not ourselves. Let’s start with programming itself. We’re still doing line-oriented programming with an alpha-numeric character set. We’re still using programming languages that, for the most part, behave like C or like LISP, and the biggest debates in the programming community are about which of these ancient paradigms is better. We have IDEs that make it somewhat easier to generate those virtual punch cards, but don’t fundamentally change the nature of the beast. We have version control tools for managing changes to those punch cards. And we even have tools for continuous integration, continuous deployment, and container orchestration—all of which are programmed by creating more virtual punch cards.

      "I have some ideas about where such a language might come from. I see two trends that might help us think about the future of programming. First, I see increasing evidence that there are two kinds of programmers: programmers who build things by connecting other things together, and programmers who create the things that others connect together. You can’t do without either, though the world needs more plumbers than designers. I don’t think so; I can imagine a language that is highly optimized for connecting pre-built operations, but not for building the operations themselves. You can see a glimpse of this in languages that apply functions to every element of a list: you no longer need loops. If you think such a programming paradigm is too radical, too far away from the process of making a machine do your bidding, think about what the machine language programmers of the 1950s would think about a modern optimizing compiler. In fact, we’re building it already. That’s really a complete tool suite that runs from automated assembly through automated testing to fully automated production.

      "More than anything else, O'Reilly's AI Conference was about making the leap to AI 2.0.At the start of O'Reilly's Artificial Intelligence Conference in New York this year, Intel's Gadi Singer made a point that resonated through the conference: \"Machine learning and deep learning are being put to work now.\" Now that AI is moving out of the laboratory and into offices and homes, a number of questions are more important than ever. Madry showed how easy it was to turn a pig into a jet by adding noise, or to become a movie star by changing your glasses. But the work that it takes to get to AI 2.0 will benefit us. We'll never have AI systems that don't make mistakes; but mistakes will be fewer, and they'll be more like the mistakes that humans make, rather than mistakes that are nonsensical. No more flying pigs. And that commonality might make it easier for those systems to work alongside us. Danielle Dean of Microsoft showed how they built a recommendation system for machine learning pipelines; it sampled the space of possible pipelines and made recommendations about which to try. Stanford's Chris Ré demonstrated Snorkel, an open source tool for automating the process of tagging training data. An AI system has three components: a model, training data, and hardware. But those approaches won't work in industry. There are many diseases we know are genetic; we just don't know what parts of the genome are responsible. We will only be able to diagnose and treat those diseases when we understand how the language of DNA works. We won't be able to handle these growing threats without the assistance of AI. The conference sessions covered everything from advanced AI techniques in reinforcement learning and natural language processing to business applications, to deploying AI applications at scale. But as Aleksander Madry said, we need to make AI human-ready.\n",

Among respondents whose organizations have adopted cloud native infrastructure, 88% use containers and 69% use orchestration tools like Kubernetes. New respondents work at organizations that have been cloud native for less than one year; early respondents’ organizations have been cloud native for one to three years; and sophisticated respondents work at organizations that have been cloud native for more than three years. Important cloud native tools like Docker (released in 2013) and Kubernetes (released in 2015) are both relatively new.

      "Resolving the volatility problem will unlock the groundwork needed for blockchain-based global payment systems.For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the long game of blockchain ecosystems is to create open platforms controlled by no single authority, inviting open participation from anyone. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged by various means to a traditional fiat currency to maintain its price or is backed by precious metals and other commodities. To date, there have been stablecoins backed by fiat currencies in reserve, gold, and even cryptocurrency itself. Value opportunity: Open platforms\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart contracting platforms have the potential to solve problems “once and for all,” in the same vein as cloud service providers touting infrastructural block storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob) and computing power (Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Compute). Due to their open nature, smart contracts may easily extend to the application layer and offer turnkey solutions to digital money, trade financing, supply chain management, and sharing economies. With the rise of stablecoins, businesses incur smaller currency risks and transaction fees. Due to a guarantee on the price of the asset being processed, there is minimal volatility risk and users and businesses alike can benefit from this stability. The first two attempts at creating stablecoins came from both BitUSD of BitShares, and NuBits—both of which were crypto collateralized iterations. Although Tether offered the creation and redemption process typically associated with reserve backed stablecoins, its lack of transparency paved the way for transparent reserve backed stablecoins such as CENTRE’s USDC and Gemini’s GUSD. There are, in fact, three types of stablecoin implementations: reserve backed, crypto collateralized, and algorithmic, each with its own associated risks and tradeoffs. While reserve backed implementations provide transparency and absolute stability from natural arbitrage opportunities, there is added counterparty risk from the centralized controller. Crypto collateralized implementations forego counterparty risk at the expense of the volatility from their underlying collateral. Stablecoin implementation types\n",

      "Reserve backed\n",
      "\n",
      "A reserve backed stablecoin is one that is typically issued by a central provider and is backed 1:1 to a fiat currency by means of both a tokenization and redemption process. The provider typically has the underlying collateral under custody with regular attestation reports, and “burns” or removes the tokens from circulation once they are redeemed. Recent examples of reserve backed stablecoins include Gemini’s GUSD, CENTRE’s USDC, and Paxos’ PAX. Legacy reserve backed stablecoin Tether (USDT) has suffered much scrutiny due to the provider’s lack of regular auditing of the underlying collateral. However, the latest class of reserve backed stablecoins have been consistently providing audit reports from reputable firms. Reserve backed stablecoins typically retain their peg from arbitrage cycles. For example, if Gemini’s GUSD is trading under $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to buy the asset until it stabilizes and redeem the tokens for the underlying collateral, thereby making a profit. If the asset is trading over $1, arbitrageurs are incentivized to send collateral to Gemini in order to generate new tokens and sell them for the higher rate. Crypto collateralized\n",
      "\n",
      "A crypto collateralized stablecoin is one that has cryptocurrency as its underlying collateral and uses price feeds associated with the collateral as a means of keeping the stablecoin at one dollar. Originally launched in 2017, DAI, the crypto collateralized stablecoin from the MakerDAO project, has remained relatively stable with continued development interest. Considering limited arbitrage opportunities on a redemption process such as DAIs, external mechanisms such as these must be consulted to maintain stability. Algorithmic stablecoins aren’t backed by collateral, but rather have speculators involved with associated secondary and tertiary assets to keep the system balanced. Algorithmic stablecoins are typically reliant on an elastic supply scheme building on Robert Sam’s Seigniorage Shares, where a base stable-asset is produced, but secondary and even tertiary assets generated and redeemed to ensure system stability. One recent example of an attempt at creating such a system was Basis, a project seeking to build an algorithmic model that recently refunded investors. To date, there are more than a dozen launched stablecoin projects with more continually being developed to serve different purposes. Even BlockFi, a competitor to Dharma, recently announced the integration of GUSD on their platform to help users avoid volatility. For example, Ethfinex, DDex, and Kyber Network have all listed DAI on their exchanges in order to better assist new traders and those who need to exchange assets and avoid risk after liquidation. Even seasoned traders can now use DAI in order to hedge risk in short-term market fluctuations and benefit from its stability. There are a number of additional projects in the process of launching this year, including MelonPort, an asset management protocol, and Origin, a marketplace generation protocol that will also accept stablecoins as a way to mitigate volatility risk. However, their implementations will definitely take note of current iterations that provide a regular price peg free from value fluctuation (if a fiat currency), the least amount of risk for users. However, stablecoins for the foreseeable future will continue to provide a key stability mechanism by way of the policy and monetary controls we are starting to see implemented in some popular stablecoins today. Not only does this allow them to save on transaction fees associated with more traditional systems, but it also allows them to guarantee stability in their walled gardens while using cryptocurrency.\n",
